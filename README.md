# backend-development-workspace

**Name:** Marlee Heiken  

**Course:** Backend Development

**Purpose:** This repository serves as my **digital notebook** for backend development.  

## Overview of backend development workspace
This repo will hold the projects I build, skills I develop, and resources I collect throughout the course 

## Learning objectives for the course
**Throught this course I am excited to learn how to:**
- Build RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js with proper CRUD operations
- Design relational databases with efficient relationships and data persistence
- Implement secure authentication and role-based authorization systems
- Handle errors gracefully and validate user input for production-ready applications
- Write comprehensive tests and deploy applications to cloud platforms
- Document APIs professionally and manage code with version control
- Create applications that demonstrate enterprise-level backend capabilities

## How I plan to use this repository throughout the semester
Throughout the semester, I plan to store both my in progress and completed backend projects here
I'll also maintain a learning-log.md file documenting my backend development goals
and a resources.md file with useful backend development links I've discovered
